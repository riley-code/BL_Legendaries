# BL_Legendaries
A discord bot I made that scrapes the official wiki and give the meaning behind the red text on legendary borderlands items.

HEADERS: If you decide to use this discord bot yourself, when importing the file replace the text seen with your User Agent. This can be found by searching google for "my user agent" and you can copy the string shown and replace the filler text in the actual file.

TOKEN: To run our file and start our discord bot we need access to its TOKEN, this can be found under your bot settings here: https://discord.com/developers/applications , once you obtain this token you can replace the text found in our file with the TOKEN you copied.

.note: (This bot was made for personal use, do not share your TOKEN with anyone else and it allows anyone with access to make changes to your bot at free will.)


SETUP
=====
1. If you don't know how to setup your own discord bot / application in python this is the guide I used and it was extremely fast to get started. https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/
2. Once you have your bot created save discord_bot.py to an easy to access directory or create a new one within your IDE.
3. After replacing the HEADER and TOKEN placeholders in the file with your own, save the file and you can now run it. (I prefer to just run the file through my command line and keep the window minimized until I am done using it for the day.)


HOW TO USE
==========
1.Create a "throwaway" channel in your discord to search for items and receive their results. (further configuration can be made to only trigger the bot on a command type of basis, e.g. " /search , $search ".
2.Once everything is up and running, now just type in any legendary item from Borderlands 3 that you come across, and the bot will return the description of the item's unique *red text*.

Keep in mind this will query any messages you type anywhere in your server, that's why I reccomend creating a test server or only using in pesonal servers.
